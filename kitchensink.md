### Random 
> Whoa, your first section is _random_?
- `watch -n <x seconds> <command>`
- `cat -T <file>` differ space from tab
- `cut -f1 <vcf> | uniq`  check chromosome sorting
- `jq` handles json IO/parsing and [the manual](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) is amazing! [More advanced examples](https://www.fabian-keller.de/blog/5-useful-jq-commands-parse-json-cli/)
- `grep -A n "pattern"` look further down n line, `-B n`: look n line above

### Nextflow
Starting a short note on nextflow which I recently found extremely nice to work with:
- [The best starter](https://github.com/danrlu/Nextflow_cheatsheet)
- [Some overly simplified schemes](https://github.com/nextflow-io/patterns)
- [Some good examples](https://github.com/nextflow-io/awesome-nextflow), although maybe outdated (e.g. not in dsl2)
- [dsl2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html)
